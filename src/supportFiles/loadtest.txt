Not worth of money
I received the product as mentioned date..but Invoice imei number and received mobile imei numbers are different....i call amazon upto 4 pepole in customer care to regenerate the new invoice for received mobile imei number .. customer care support not answer properly. All people asking time but till now problem not solved...New invoice not generated. ..
The phone arrived without accessories on complaining they didn't bother answering properly. Seems to be their USP for selling cheap iPhones.I would insist rather move to another online portals where the complaints are heard and resovled
Amazon you still remain my favorite however you need some serious improvements in your services when it comes to amazon.in.
The look and the feel is simply awesome. The phone is very slim and looks absolutely great in your palm.
i ordered for english willow but it is not english willow bat . its ok for Rs.1780/- 
I received a completely different product very disappointed with it, and this product comes with a no return policy. I wouldn't recommend this vendor.
